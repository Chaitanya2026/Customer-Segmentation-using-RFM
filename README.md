# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using RFM

This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers of an online retail dataset. The goal is to identify high-value customer groups such as **Platinum**, **Gold**, **Silver**, and **Standard** to drive better marketing and retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Segment customers based on **how recently**, **how often**, and **how much** they purchase.
- Gain actionable insights to improve **targeted marketing**, **customer loyalty**, and **sales strategy**.

## 📊 What is RFM?

- **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** Number of purchases  
- **Monetary (M):** Total spend by the customer

Each customer is scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high) in each category.
